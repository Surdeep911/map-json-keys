First import all files excluding js3.json

run the 'jsonCreate.py' file..

The program should start importing js1.json and js2.json files and load it to temp variables

There will be a third json variable 'data3' defined and that will fetch keys of js1 and js2

here..
data3.keys() will have keys of js1
data3.values() will have keys of js2

now we're creating a new json variable data4,
which will contain keys of js1 & values of js2
